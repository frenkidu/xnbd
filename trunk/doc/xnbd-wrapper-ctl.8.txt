xnbd-wrapper-ctl - Manage an xnbd-wrapper(8) super-server.


SYNOPSIS
--------
xnbd-wrapper-ctl [--socket 'SOCKETPATH'] [--add 'FILE']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
With the *xnbd-wrapper-ctl* command you can connect to an xnbd-wrapper control
channel and instruct it to act as directed. You may pass certain commands as
argument to the control program which are then forwarded, on your behalf, to
the xnbd-server instance.


OPTIONS
-------
The following options are supported:

*--add*|*-a* 'FILE'::
    Instruct the xnbd-wrapper to add the given 'FILE' as exported xNBD
    device.

*--add-proxy* 'TARGET_HOST' 'TARGET_PORT' 'CACHE_IMAGE' 'BITMAP_IMAGE' 'CONTROL_SOCKET_PATH'::
    Instruct the xnbd-wrapper to add a proxy to the given target server.

*--help*|*-h*::
    Display a short usage overview and exit

*--list*|*-l*::
    Connects to the xNBD wrapper and retrieves the list of exported file
    names

*--remove*|*-r* 'INDEX'::
    Instruct the xnbd-wrapper to remove the volume exported on 'INDEX'
    from the list of exported xNBD devices.

*--socket*|*-s* 'SOCKETPATH'::
    Connect to 'SOCKETPATH' as xnbd-wrapper control socket. Default is
    /tmp/xnbd_wrapper.ctl.

*--target-exportname* 'NAME'::
    Set the export name to request from the proxied xnbd-wrapper target.
    This option is used in combination with *--add-proxy*, only.
