NAME
----
xnbd-wrapper - Manage multiple files to be exported as a block device to other
               computers running the GNU/Linux(tm) Operating System

SYNOPSIS
--------
*xnbd-wrapper* [ --imgfile 'IMAGE' [--imgfile 'IMAGE' ...] ]
    [--laddr 'ADDRESS'] [--lport 'PORT'] [--socket 'PATH'] [--xnbd-server 'PATH']
    [--daemonize] [--logpath 'PATH']
    [--max-buf-size 'NUMBER'] [--max-queue-size 'NUMBER']
    [--dbpath 'PATH']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*xnbd-wrapper* is a super-server for xnbd-server. Its purpose is to manage
multiple exported images at once. A client may connect to this super-server and
it will be indirected to the actual xnbd-server providing the requested
resource.

*xnbd-wrapper* comes handy if you want to export multiple files (or block
devices) on a single host. Instead of starting multiple xnbd-server instances
and remember the exported port for each, you can use *xnbd-wrapper* to looks up
the requested image file name and map it automatically to the corresponding
xnbd-server.


OPTIONS
-------
The following options are supported:

*--daemonize*::
    Go into background as soon as the xnbd-server is started up

*--imgfile* 'IMAGE'::
    Export the image file 'IMAGE' through *xnbd-wrapper*, with 'IMAGE'
    being a block device or a file name of an image file.
    +
    *xnbd-wrapper* will export the file name accessible through this name
    to clients, which may connect to the server by providing this name
    +
    This option can be specified multiple times. In this case, xnbd-wrapper
    will export all 'IMAGE' files at once. Alternatively, this
    argument can be omitted and images may be (un-)exported ar runtime
    with xnbd-wrapper-ctl.

*--laddr* 'ADDRESS'::
    The address, where this wrapper shall listen for incoming connections.
    You can specify any resolvable hostname or IP address, being
    in IPv4 or IPv6 notation.

*--logpath* 'FILE'::
    Log informational messages to file 'FILE' rather than stderr/syslog.

*--syslog*::
    Log informational messages to syslog.

*--lport* 'PORT'::
    Accept incoming connections on the given 'PORT'. A valid port is any
    number between 1 and 65536. You may not use the same listeing port
    more than once per system. If this argument is not given, xNBD will
    listen on port 8520 by default.

(*--port* 'PORT')::
    Deprecated, use *--lport* instead.
    This option might be removed in future releases.

*--socket* 'PATH'::
    The xNBD wrapper can be controlled through a control socket. When
    given, use 'PATH' as file name, default is /var/run/xnbd-wrapper.ctl.

*--xnbd-bgctl* 'COMMAND'::
    Specifies the path to the xnbd-bgctl executable.
    'COMMAND' can be a file name or a command to resolve to a file name
    using `$PATH`.   By default, "xnbd-bgctl" resolved from `$PATH` is used.

*--xnbd-server* 'COMMAND'::
    Specifies the path to the xnbd-server executable. The wrapper will
    spawn server instances on demand.
    'COMMAND' can be a file name or a command to resolve to a file name
    using `$PATH`.   By default, "xnbd-server" resolved from `$PATH` is used.

(*--xnbd-binary* 'PATH')::
    Deprecated, use *--xnbd-server* 'PATH' instead.
    This option might be removed in future releases.

*--cow*::
    Invoke xnbd-server(8) instances using parameter --cow-target.

*--readonly*::
    Invoke xnbd-server(8) instances using parameter --readonly.

*--max-queue-size* 'NUMBER'::
    Parameter forwarded to proxy mode xnbd-server on invocation.
    See *xnbd-server(8)* for details..

*--max-buf-size* 'NUMBER'::
    Parameter forwarded to proxy mode xnbd-server on invocation.
    See *xnbd-server(8)* for details.

*--dbpath* 'PATH'::
    Use 'PATH' for persisting database state,
    defaults to /var/lib/xnbd/xnbd.state.
    For documentation of the database file format, please see
    *xnbd-wrapper-load(8)*.
