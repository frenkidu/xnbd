NAME
----
xnbd-register - Restore xNBD sessions upon boot


SYNOPSIS
--------
*xnbd-register* [--quiet] --start

*xnbd-register* [--quiet] --stop

*xnbd-register* [--quiet] --restart

*xnbd-register* [--quiet] --status


DESCRIPTION
-----------
With the xnbd-register command one can restore xnbd-server and xnbd-client
sessions based on a configuration file.  This is useful to start client,
server or both upon boot.

To achieve this, xnbd-register reads a semi-structured configuration file
located in /etc/xnbd.conf.  See below for format hints.


OPTIONS
-------
The following options are supported:

*--start*::
    Start devices configured in the configuration files.  If the configuration
    files describes volumes, xnbd-register will try to establish a client
    connection to the configured server instance.
    +
    Alternatively, xnbd-register will start sharing configured volumes by
    starting an xnbd-wrapper super server.

*--status*::
    Retrieve server status from a running xnbd-wrapper command, if applicable.

*--stop*::
    Analogous to the start option, the stop argument will stop all xnbd
    connection, being client or server instances.

*--restart*::
    Restart all xnbd instances, being client or server

*--quiet*::
    Do not produce verbose output


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
xnbd-register will read its defaults from /etc/xnbd.conf.  This is a
semi-structured configuration file, describing client and server connections
that are supposed to be restored upon start of the system.

The syntax of the file is a JSON data structure, allowing comments starting
with a hash key ("#"). Two types of objects are recognized: xnbd volumes
and a server instance.  xnbd volumes are indexed by the supposed devices name.
This is, to restore /dev/nbd0 an object named "nbd0" must be configured.
Valid arguments are host, name and port.  So, for example, this is to
configure /dev/nbd0 connecting to localhost on port 8520.  If present,
identify the shared device by the configured logical name:

---------------------------
"nbd0": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8520,
    "name": "name"
}
---------------------------

Similarly, a server instance configures an xnbd-wrapper. Valid options are:

*address*::
    Specifies the listening address

*port*::
    Specifies the listening port

*socket*::
    Specifies the listening socket for the control channels

*logpath*::
    Specifies the log path where logging output is being redirected to

*volumes*::
    A list of volumes which are exported

---------------------------
"server": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8520,
    "socket": "/var/run/xnbd.ctl",
    "logpath": "/tmp/xnbd.log",
    "volumes": [ "/dev/volume", "/dev/sdb1", "/var/lib/image.file" ]
}
---------------------------
