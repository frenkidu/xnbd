NAME
----
xnbd-bgctl - Control a server running xnbd-server(8) through its control socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*xnbd-bgctl* --query 'CONTROL_SOCKET'

*xnbd-bgctl* [--force] --switch 'CONTROL_SOCKET'

*xnbd-bgctl* [--progress] [--blocks-per-request 'COUNT'] --cache-all 'CONTROL_SOCKET'

*xnbd-bgctl* [--exportname 'NAME'] --reconnect 'CONTROL_SOCKET' 'REMOTE_HOST' 'REMOTE_PORT'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
With the xnbd-bgctl command you can connect to an xnbd-server control channel
and instruct it to act as directed. You may pass an argument to the control
program which is then forwarded, on your behalf, to the server instance.


OPTIONS
-------
The following options are supported:

*--cache-all*::
    If the remote xnbd-server acts as proxy server, this command
    instructs the controlling xnbd-server instance to cache all blocks
    on its associated block disk. Upon completion the controlled xnbd-server
    instance holds all data from the origin instance and it is no longer
    necessary to act as proxy.

*--cache-all2*::
    This command is identical to *--cache-all* but detaches the process from
    the terminal and is hence using a dedicated connection for data
    transfer. Not fully implemented yet.

*--query*::
    Retrieve cache completion statistics from the proxy server, and display the
    number of cached blocks.

*--reconnect*::
    This command recovers from a lost connection by re-establishing
    connectivity with the origin server. This command expects two
    additional arguments, the 'REMOTE_HOST', and the 'REMOTE_PORT' you want
    to connect to, to recover from a disconnected session.

*--switch*::
    Stop the proxy server and restart it in target mode.
    All client sessions are preserved.

*--exportname* 'NAME'::
    Specify the volume name to be requested. If a target server (e.g.,
    xnbd-wrapper) exports multiple volumes through a single TCP port, this
    option needs to be specified.
    This option is used with `--reconnect`.

*--blocks-per-request* 'COUNT'::
    Request up to 'COUNT' blocks at once. `--help` shows the default value.
    This option is used with `--cache-all`.

*--progress*::
    Show a progress bar on stderr. Disabled by default.
    This option is used with `--cache-all'.

*--force*::
    Forcibly do an operation, ignoring the risk of data loss. Disabled by default.
    This option is used with `--switch'.

(*--shutdown*)::
    Deprecated alias to *--switch*.


POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
--------------------
The following positional options are supported:

'CONTROL_SOCKET'::
    The Unix domain socket, the xnbd-server(8) program is listening on.
